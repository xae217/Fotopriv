Fotopriv - Photo Privacy Detecion 
Senior Project by Xavier Escobar.


## Quick summary ##
The goal is to implement an Android application that is able to detect privacy in photos and alert the user that it contains sensitive information. 

## Current Progress ##
I have implemented a demo using OpenCV's Android port and Caffe's GoogLeNet pre-trained model.
The demo allows the user to select an image, or take a picture of an object and get a prediction of an object. 
It takes about ~3 seconds to get a prediction.
